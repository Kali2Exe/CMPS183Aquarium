1. Product Backlog:
Ideas: buy fish based on time, goals completed, or time


Web Application/extension
An app that allows the user to raise fish based on the amount of time
the app is left open. The longer the app is open, without switching
to other apps, the more rewarding the fish. Used to monitor productivity,
phone usage, time, and gives user some motivation to get whatever
they need done.
