Sprint 1 Report
Productivity Aquarium
Team Fishai
2/13/17

Actions to stop doing: 
The team is satisfied with the current pace and scale of the project. There are no habits, tendencies or inconsistencies to speak of that the team wishes to stop doing. 

Actions to start doing: 
The team was overall lacking in, non-scrum communications. Given that there are only three scrums per week, the team has noticed a pattern where there are off days where a team member will have completed a task or request assistance with a task and not receive help in a reasonable amount of time. One of the things we wish to start doing is constantly checking the scrum board and Slack channel for updates and questions. 

Actions to keep doing: 
The early morning scrum meetings we are doing allow for all member to attend the scrum meetings and attend class right afterward. We also wish to maintain our current workflow pattern and pace and seek to complete our user stories in time for the upcoming sprint. 

Work completed: 
- As a user, I would like a game where I raise fish because aquariums are calming and fun. 
- As a user, I would like to block websites because I would use them to procrastinate. 

Work completion rate: 
- User stories completed: 2 / 2
- Estimated work hours: 22.5 hours
